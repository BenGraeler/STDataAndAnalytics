# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.
-->

## Project team
<!-- 
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to go?
-->

The authors are well equipped for the tasks proposed. Edzer Pebesma is author and maintainer of `sf` and `gstat`, and initiated `sftime`. Ben Graeler is author and maintainer of `spcopula`, co-author of `gstat` and `spacetime`, and is well aware of the recent `sf` and `stars` developments. Both have worked together in the last couple of years on both data science projects as on software development projects.

The majority of the developments will be handled by [Benedikt Gr√§ler](https://github.com/bengraeler).
[Edzer Pebesma](https://github.com/edzer) will mostly have an
advisory role, and and act as reviewer of pull requests, vignettes
and blog posts.

The need for the `sftime` package has been extensively discussed among the participants of the [OpenGeoHub summer school in September 2019](https://opengeohub.org/summer_school_2019). This discussion has led to a first, prototypical (and very incomplete) implementation of the package.
