Analysis of spatio-temporal data is a very important means to understand, model and predict our environment. With the rapid advancement of the [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) package for spatial data and the [`stars`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stars) package for regular spatial and spatio-temporal data, a new standard of spatial and spatio-temporal data handling has emerged. However, spatial statistical packages need to be adopted to fully benefit from the new developments. While coercen methods are in place and ensure a good deal of backwards compatibility, these transformations between data represenations are time and resource consuming and might be confusing to novice users. This hinders a straightforward deeper analysis of the data. Now, that the new developemts around `sf` and `stars` have settled, users ask for compatibility between data representaions and modelling tools. 

Furthermore, `stars` only handles regular spatio-temporal data, and there is a strong need to also cover irregular spatio-temporal data (e.g. eathquakes, desease outbreaks, trajectories of vehicles or individuals). The package [`sftime`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sftime) has been initialised, but needs to be fully developed in order to close the gap for irregular spatio-temporal data.
